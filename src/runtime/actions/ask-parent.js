/**
 * Ask Parent Action — Allow a delegate agent to ask a question to the agent that invoked it.
 *
 * When a delegate agent cannot proceed due to missing information that cannot be found
 * by reading the codebase, it can use this action to ask the calling (parent) agent.
 * The runtime intercepts the signal, calls the parent agent's LLM to answer, and
 * re-invokes the delegate with args.answer set to the answer.
 *
 * This is a generic runtime mechanism that works for any parent/child agent pair.
