    EXACT SEQUENCE - Do each step once only:

    1. prompt_user with question "What is your name?" - save as ID "a1"
    2. print greeting using template variable for a1.output.answer: "Hello, (name here)! It's great to meet you!"
    3. prompt_user with question "Do you want to continue?" and options ["Yes", "No"] - save as ID "a2"
    4. if action with condition that checks if a2.output.answer equals 'Yes':
       - then: [
           prompt_user with question "What is your age?" - save as ID "a3",
           print message about their age using template variable for a3.output.answer
         ]
       - else: [
           print "Goodbye! Maybe next time."
         ]

    IMPORTANT:
    - DO NOT repeat questions. Each prompt_user should happen exactly once.
    - Use proper template variable syntax in the actions you generate
    - The if action needs proper string quoting in the condition
